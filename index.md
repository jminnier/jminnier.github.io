I am an Associate Professor of Biostatistics at Oregon Health & Sciences University. I am
a faculty member of the [OHSU-PSU School of Public Health](http://ohsu-psu-sph.org/) with appointments in the Knight
Cardiovascular Institute and Knight Cancer Institute Biostatistics Shared Resource.
My statistical research interests include risk prediction with high dimensional data sets and the
analysis of genetic and other omics data.

I am also interested in statistical computing (mostly in R), reproducible research and open science.
I am also excited to be a [NASA Datanaut](https://open.nasa.gov/explore/datanauts/) as of [Spring 2018](https://open.nasa.gov/explore/datanauts/2018/spring-2018/) <i class="fa fa-rocket" aria-hidden="true"></i>.

I teach Mathematics/Statistics II, a statistical inference course for the [MS in Biostatistics program](http://ohsu-psu-sph.org/index.php/ms-in-biostatistics/)
at OHSU-PSU School of Public Health.

I have an A.M. and Ph.D. in Biostatistics from [Harvard University](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) and a B.A. in Mathematics with minor in Computer
Science from [Lewis & Clark College](https://college.lclark.edu/departments/mathematical_sciences/).
